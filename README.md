# **iPhone 15 Pro Website Recreation**

Welcome to my recreation of Apple's iPhone 15 Pro website! This project was created using a tutorial that was meant to be a practice exercise to enhance my skills in React, Three.js, GSAP, and modern web development techniques. The goal was to replicate the seamless user experience and high-quality animations characteristic of Apple's product pages, with a strong emphasis on smooth transitions, interactive elements, and 3D graphics.

## ðŸš€ **Technologies and Dependencies**

This project utilizes a range of modern web technologies to achieve a high-performance and visually engaging website.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of reusable components and efficient rendering.
- **Three.js**: A powerful 3D graphics library that allows for the creation of complex 3D models and animations, used here to render a 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A robust animation library used to create smooth animations and transitions, enhancing the overall visual appeal and interactivity of the website.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server, providing a modern environment for React projects with instant updates and optimized builds.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that facilitates the rapid development of responsive and consistent UI designs.
- **React-Three/Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, allowing seamless integration of 3D graphics within the React component model.

## ðŸ“‹ **Features**
- Hero Sections and Sliders: Replicates the sleek hero sections and image sliders found on Apple's official iPhone pages, providing a visually appealing and intuitive layout.
- 3D Model Integration: Utilizes Three.js to display a 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro, allowing users to interact with the model through rotations and animations.
- Smooth Animations and Transitions: Leveraging GSAP for animations, the website features smooth scrolling effects, fade-ins, and other animations that enhance the user experience and mimic Apple's design language.
- Responsive Design: Ensures optimal viewing across all device sizes, from desktops to mobile phones, maintaining a seamless and consistent user experience.
- Dynamic Content and Interactive Elements: Features interactive sections that respond to user input, such as scroll triggers, animated text, and hover effects.

## ðŸ“¦ **Deployment**
The website is planned for deployment soon! Stay tuned for the live version to be available:
